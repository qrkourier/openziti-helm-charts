Host an OpenZiti controller in Kubernetes

## Requirements

| Repository | Name | Version |
|------------|------|---------|
| https://charts.jetstack.io | cert-manager | ~1.11.0 |
| https://charts.jetstack.io | trust-manager | ~0.7.0 |
| https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/ | ingress-nginx | ~4.5.2 |

## Overview

This chart runs a Ziti controller in Kubernetes. It uses the custom resources provided by [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/) and [trust-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/projects/trust-manager/#installation), i.e., Issuer, Certificate, and Bundle. Delete the controller pod after an upgrade for the new controller configuration to take effect.

Here's a checklist that must be satisfied for each of the controller's TLS servers: router control plane (`ctrlPlane`), each web listener(s) (`clientApi`, at least).

1. Each of the controller's TLS servers must have an advertised host (FQDN) and TCP port. The chart ensures the DNS SAN is added for this address. The port is always 443 if ingress is enabled for `ClusterIP` service.
1. A K8s Service must be configured and reachable by all clients. (i.e., type `ClusterIP`+`Ingress`, `NodePort`, or `LoadBalancer`)
1. Each K8s Service must be configured for TLS passthrough (i.e., server TLS must not be terminated by an intermediary LB).
1. All clients must access the controller through the advertised address(es).

## Requirements

### Add the OpenZiti Charts Repo to Helm

```bash
helm repo add openziti https://docs.openziti.io/helm-charts/
```

This chart requires Certificate, Issuer, and Bundle resources to be applied before installing the chart. Sub-charts `cert-manager`, and `trust-manager` will be installed automatically. You may disable the sub-charts if you wish to provide these resources separately, but if you do so then please use the sub-chart values at the foot of Values.yaml to ensure those charts are correctly configured.

### Install Required Custom Resource Definitions

This step satisfies Helm's requirement that the CRDs used in the umbrella chart
already exist in Kubernetes before installing the controller chart.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/latest/download/cert-manager.crds.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cert-manager/trust-manager/v0.9.0/deploy/crds/trust.cert-manager.io_bundles.yaml
```

## Minimal Installation

This first example shows a minimal installation for a Kubernetes distribution that provides TLS pass-through for Service type LoadBalancer, e.g., k3s, k3d, Minikube. This is useful for environments where there's no cost, or justifiable cost, associated with provisioning a LoadBalancer with TLS passthrough.

You must supply one value when you install the chart.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
|clientApi.advertisedHost|string|nil|the DNS name that edge clients and routers will resolve to reach this controller's edge client API|
|clientApi.advertisedPort|string|nil|the TCP port associated with the advertisedHost to advertise to edge clients and routers|

```bash
helm install \
    --namespace ziti-controller ziti-controller-minimal1 \
    openziti/ziti-controller \
        --set clientApi.advertisedHost="ziti-controller-minimal.example.com" \
        --set clientApi.advertisedPort="443"
```

A default admin user and password will be generated and saved to a secret during installation. The credentials can be retrieved using this command:

<!-- {% raw %} "raw" escapes this code block's handlebars from GH Pages Jekyll, and  escapes the Go template from helm-docs -->
```bash
kubectl get secret \
    -n ziti-controller ziti-controller-minimal1-admin-secret \
    -o go-template='{{range $k,$v := .data}}{{printf "%s: " $k}}{{if not $v}}{{$v}}{{else}}{{$v | base64decode}}{{end}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'
```
<!-- {% endraw %} -->

Visit the Ziti Administration Console (ZAC): https://ziti-controller-minimal.example.com/zac/

You may log in the `ziti` CLI with one command or omit the `-p` part to prompt:

<!-- {% raw %} "raw" escapes this code block's handlebars from GH Pages Jekyll, and  escapes the Go template from helm-docs -->
```bash
ziti edge login ziti-controller-minimal.example.com:1280 \
    --yes \
    --username admin \
    --password $(
        kubectl -n ziti-controller \
            get secrets ziti-controller-minimal1-admin-secret \
                -o go-template='{{index .data "admin-password" | base64decode }}'
        )
```
<!-- {% endraw %} -->

## Using ClusterIP Services with an Ingress Controller

The default K8s service type for this chart is `ClusterIP`. You can publish these cluster-internal services with an `Ingress` resource. You need an Ingress Controller. Here's an example of using [the community `ingress-nginx` chart](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installing-nic/installation-with-helm/) to provision ingresses for the controller's `ClusterIP` services.

Ensure you have the `ingress-nginx` chart installed with `controller.extraArgs.enable-ssl-passthrough=true`. You can verify this feature is enabled by running `kubectl describe pods {ingress-nginx-controller pod}` and checking the args for `--enable-ssl-passthrough=true`.

If necessary, patch the `ingress-nginx` deployment to enable TLS passthrough.

```bash
kubectl patch deployment "ingress-nginx-controller" \
    --namespace ingress-nginx \
    --type json \
    --patch '[{"op": "add",
        "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-",
        "value":"--enable-ssl-passthrough"
    }]'
```

Create a Helm chart values file like this.

```yaml
# /tmp/controller-values.yml
clientApi:
    advertisedHost: ziti-controller-managed.example.com
    advertisedPort: 443
    service:
        type: ClusterIP
    ingress:
        enabled: true
        ingressClassName: nginx
        annotations:
            kubernetes.io/ingress.allow-http: "false"
            nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: "true"
```

Now install or upgrade this controller chart with your values file.

```bash
helm install \
    --namespace ziti-controller ziti-controller-managed1 \
    openziti/ziti-controller \
    --values /tmp/controller-values.yml
```

### Expose the Router Control Plane

This is applicable if you have any routers outside the Ziti controller's cluster. You must configure pass-through TLS LoadBalancer or Ingress for the control plane service. Routers running in the same cluster as the controller can use the cluster service named `{controller release}-ctrl` (the "ctrl" endpoint). This example demonstrates a pass-through Ingress resource for `nginx-ingress`.

Merge this with your Helm chart values file before installing or upgrading.

```yaml
ctrlPlane:
    advertisedHost: ziti-controller-managed-ctrl.example.com
    advertisedPort: 443
    service:
        enabled: true
    ingress:
        enabled: true
        ingressClassName: nginx
        annotations:
            kubernetes.io/ingress.allow-http: "false"
            nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: "true"
```

## Extra Security for the Management API

You can split the client and management APIs into separate cluster services by setting `managementApi.service.enabled=true`. With this configuration, you'll have an additional cluster service named `{release}-mgmt` that is the management API, and the client API will not have management features.

This Helm chart's values allow for both operational scenarios: combined and split. The default choice is to expose the combined client and management APIs as the cluster service named `{release}-client`, which is convenient because you can use the `ziti` CLI immediately. For additional security, you may shelter the management API by splitting these two sets of features, exposing them as separate API servers. After the split, you can access the management API in several ways:

* deploy a tunneler to bind a Ziti service targeting {release}-mgmt.{namespace}.svc:{port}.
* `kubectl -n {namespace} port-forward deployments/{release}-mgmt 8443:{port}`

The web console (ZAC) is always bound to the same web listener as the management API, so you can access it at that `/zac/` path on the same URL.

## Advanced PKI

The default configuration generates a singular PKI root of trust for all the controller's servers and the edge signer CA. Optionally, you may provide the name of a cert-manager Issuer or ClusterIssuer to become the root of trust for the Ziti controller's identity.

Merge this with your Helm chart values file before installing or upgrading.

```yaml
ctrlPlane:
    issuer:
        kind: ClusterIssuer
        name: my-alternative-cluster-issuer
```

You may also configure the Ziti controller to use separate PKI roots of trust for its three main identities: control plane, edge signer, and web bindings.

For example, to use a separate CA for the edge signer function, merge this with your Helm chart values file before installing or upgrading.

```yaml
edgeSignerPki:
    enabled: true
```

## Prometheus Monitoring

This chart provides a default disabled `ziti-controller-prometheus` k8s service for prometheus,
which can be enabled with `prometheus.service.enabled`. Enabling it will create a prometheus ServiceMonitor
for configuring the prometheus endpoint. It is also important that you enable
`fabric.events.enabled` for getting a full set of metrics.

For more information, please check [here](https://openziti.io/docs/learn/core-concepts/metrics/prometheus/).

## TODO's

* replicas - Each controller replica needs to be it's own HA member. We have to wait until HA https://github.com/openziti/ziti/blob/release-next/doc/ha/overview.md is officially released.
* lower CA / Cert lifetime; how to refresh stuff when Certs are updated?
* Deploy Prometheus scraper configuration when `prometheus.enabled = true`
* cert-manager allows issuing only one cert per key, i.e., ClientCertKeyReuseIssue prevents us from issuing a user cert and server cert backed by same private key, hence the controller config.yaml re-uses server certs in place of user certs to allow startup and testing to continue
